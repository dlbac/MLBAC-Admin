## Organizatoin AATs, OATs, and ReplayData for the Three-Tasks Administration

This directory contains the AATs, OATs, and ReplayData for each three-Tasks administration and store them in separate files. 
We combine the AATs of first three Tasks (t-1, t-2, and t-3) and store them in a single file.  
We do the same for all the eighteen Tasks and both OATs and ReplayData.

For example, `aats_task`**1**`_`**3**.`sample` file holds the AATs of Tasks **t-1**, **t-2**, and **t-3** (t-1 to t-3). 
Also, the `oats_task`**1**`_`**3**.`sample` and `replay_data_task`**1**`_`**3**.`sample` files hold the OATs and ReplayData, 
respectively, for the Tasks **t-1** to **t-3**.
