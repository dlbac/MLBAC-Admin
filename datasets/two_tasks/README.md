## Organizatoin AATs, OATs, and ReplayData for the Two-Tasks Administration

This directory contains the AATs, OATs, and ReplayData for each two-Tasks administration and store them in separate files. 
We combine the AATs of first two Tasks (t1 and t2) and store them in a single file.  We do the same for all the eighteen Tasks and both OATs and ReplayData.

For example, `aats_task`**1**`_`**2**.`sample` file holds the AATs of Tasks **t-1** and **t-2**. 
Also, the `oats_task`**1**`_`**2**.`sample` and `replay_data_task`**1**`_`**2**.`sample` files hold the OATs and ReplayData, respectively, for the Tasks **t-1** and **t-2**.
