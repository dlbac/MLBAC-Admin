## Organizatoin of AATs, OATs, and ReplayData for the Six-Tasks Administration

This directory contains the AATs, OATs, and ReplayData for each six-Tasks administration and store them in separate files. 
We combine the AATs of first six Tasks (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-4, t-5, and t-6) and store them in a single file.  
We do the same for all the eighteen Tasks and both OATs and ReplayData.

For example, `aats_task`**1**`_`**6**.`sample` file holds the AATs of Tasks **t-1** to **t-6**. 
Also, the `oats_task`**1**`_`**6**.`sample` and `replay_data_task`**1**`_`**6**.`sample` files hold the OATs and ReplayData, 
respectively, for the Tasks **t-1** to **t-6**.
